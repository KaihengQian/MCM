## Q1

> Develop a model that captures the flow of play as points occur and apply it to one or more of the matches. Your model should identify which player is performing better at a given time in the match, as well as how much better they are performing. Provide a visualization based on your model to depict the match flow. *Note: in tennis, the player serving has a much higher probability of winning the point/game. You may wish to factor this into your model in some way.*

考虑把发球胜率作为噪音去除

发球胜率用比赛中所有人的比赛数据算出来

把总时间分成好多段，作为自变量

以每段时间里的得球概率作为打分标准，去除发球胜利概率后作为在这段时间里的表现，得到表现关于时间的函数

最后可以样条差值或者EMA指数平滑
