## Q1

> Develop a model that captures the flow of play as points occur and apply it to one or more of the matches. Your model should identify which player is performing better at a given time in the match, as well as how much better they are performing. Provide a visualization based on your model to depict the match flow. *Note: in tennis, the player serving has a much higher probability of winning the point/game. You may wish to factor this into your model in some way.*

考虑把发球胜率作为噪音去除

发球胜率用比赛中所有人的比赛数据算出来

把总时间分成好多段，作为自变量

以每段时间里的得球概率作为打分标准，去除发球胜利概率后作为在这段时间里的表现，得到表现关于时间的函数

最后可以样条差值或者EMA指数平滑



## Q3

> Coaches would love to know if there are indicators that can help determine when the flow of play is about to change from favoring one player to the other. 
>
> - Using the data provided for at least one match, develop a model that predicts these swings in the match. What factors seem most related (if any)?
> - Given the differential in past match “momentum” swings how do you advise a player going into a new match against a different player? 

我们需要找一个指标来定义什么时候是“有势头”或者“势头好”

势头的影响因素（比如身体状态，因素）可以通过主成分分析或者因子分析对原始数据中的特征进行分析得到

然后对我们得到的上面这个模型得到的势头这一变量进行时间序列预测
